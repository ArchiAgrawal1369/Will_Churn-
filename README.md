# Will_Churn?
This Python Notebook aims as predicting whether a customer will churn or not using classification algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multiple Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Classifier and LGBM Classifier.
Gradiest Boosting gave the best results followed by others model which gave the same accuracy.

This notebook has been created as a part of Machine Learning Competition named, Facet'22, held at BITS Pilani.
